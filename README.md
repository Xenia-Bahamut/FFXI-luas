# FFXI-luas
Here are my job luas. Enjoy looking at them.
Some are best in slot. Some sets have gear I don't have yet in "--".

I use stars *** to make notes to myself about stuff I need to replace, or get to R15, or use for dyna, etc.

I have included some luas for jobs I used in V25 T3 Odyssey fights. Xevioso was killed in Jan 2024, Ongo in early March 2024. They usually have  changes of just more DT in idle and midcast sets.

Feel free to wave to me in game but please don't message me with corrections or questions.
