# FFXI-luas
Here are my job luas. Enjoy looking at them.
They are based on Arislan's LUAs, or someone else who based them on Arislan. I tried to give credit when I could. I prefer Arislan over Selindriles as I don't need to worry about a library or mote. I can copy the lua to someone else and have it run right out of the gate. The start of the lua has keyboard shorcuts for JAs and weaponskills.
I try to avoid the abreviations of gear and use the full names. Instead of "Spae. Petasos +3" I would use "Spaekona's Petasos +3"
Some lines have "--" which is usually gear I don't have yet or is a possible alternative.

LUAs I would consider being best in slot or nearly there:
BLU, COR, GEO, RDM, SCH, WAR
LUAs that need more work but I'd say are at least 75% of the way there or more:
BLM, BRD, DNC, NIN, THF
My WHM lua is rather lacking and is more for fast cast of Arise for "less than successful" Odyssey attempts.

I use stars *** to make notes to myself about stuff I need to replace, get to R15, use for dyna, etc.

I have included some luas for jobs I used in V25 T3 Odyssey fights. V25 Xevioso was killed in Jan 2024, V25 Ongo in early March 2024. They usually have changes of just more DT in idle and midcast sets.

Feel free to wave to me in game but please don't message me with corrections or questions.
